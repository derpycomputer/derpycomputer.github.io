Hello, and welcome to my humble abode. This'll be a little log of how I managed to break things, and then somehow found a solution to fix them again. Maybe a dash of not being able to fixing them, too. Hopefully you'll find mostly useful things here. 

I'm currently in the beginning stages of learning a bit of front-end web programming, so there might be a little bit of that as well. I'm hoping to keep a steady schedule of posting, and I'm set to start this next Monday with the actually useful stuff. In the meantime, this will have to serve as a welcome page. So, without further ado, let's get this ball rolling!
